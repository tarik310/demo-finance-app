# Business Dashboard with ML Insights

## Overview

This project is a data-driven dashboard that visualizes key business metrics and incorporates basic machine learning techniques to provide actionable insights. It simulates API calls using local JSON files for KPIs, products, transactions, and customer data, and displays this data in interactive charts and data grids.

## Features

- **Revenue & Expense Analysis:**

  - Visualize monthly revenue, expenses, and profit using area and line charts.
  - Display growth trends with dynamically calculated metrics (e.g., revenue growth percentage, profit margin).

- **Revenue Prediction:**

  - Apply polynomial regression (degree 2) on monthly revenue data to generate a trendline and forecast next year's revenue.

- **Customer Segmentation:**

  - Use K-Means clustering (via the `ml-kmeans` library) on customer data (total spent and purchase count) to segment customers into distinct groups.
  - Visualize the clusters using a scatter chart for better understanding of customer spending behavior.

- **Expense Breakdown:**

  - Compare operational versus non-operational expenses using line charts.
  - Visualize expense categories with a pie chart.

- **Product Insights & Transactions:**

  - Display lists of products and recent orders using data grids for quick reference.

- **Simulated API:**
  - A custom base query simulates network latency and serves data from local JSON files.

## Tech Stack

- **React** – UI development
- **Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)** – Data fetching and state management
- **Material-UI (MUI)** – UI components and styling
- **Recharts** – Data visualization (charts, graphs)
- **ml-kmeans** – Machine learning for customer segmentation
- **regression** – Polynomial regression for forecasting

## Machine Learning Integration

- **Revenue Prediction:**  
  The `Predictions` component uses the `regression` library to perform polynomial regression (degree 2) on monthly revenue data. This produces:

  - An **Actual Revenue** line (the data from the KPIs).
  - A **Regression Line** that models the revenue trend.
  - A **Predicted Revenue Next Year** value generated by extrapolating the regression model.

- **Customer Segmentation:**  
  The same `Predictions` component also leverages the `ml-kmeans` library to cluster customers based on:
  - **Total Spent**
  - **Number of Purchases**  
    These clusters are visualized in a scatter chart, allowing you to see distinct customer segments (e.g., high spenders vs. low spenders).
